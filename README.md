# WD045-FinalProject-FitnessPlanner

Fitlife- is the final project of WD045 batch of WBS-CODING SCHOOL's Fullstack Web and App development course. It consists on a MERN stack application styled with Tailwind.css that serves as your own personalized hub for creating and managing your workout plans as well as playing and tracking your progression. Integrated with ExerciseDB API for access to a library of exercises, you can also create your own exercises and upload custom images of them. The workout plans can also be set to public so that other users can also save and use them.
